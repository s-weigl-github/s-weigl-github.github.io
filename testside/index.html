<b>WinGup</b> is a <b>G</b>eneric <b>Up</b>dater running under <b>Win</b>dows environment.<br/>
The aim of WinGup is to provide a ready to use and configurable updater which downloads a update package then installs it.<br/>
By using cURL library and TinyXml module, GUP is capable to deal with http protocol and process XML data.

<p>
Originally WinGup was made for the need of <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> (a generic source code editor under MS Windows).
During its conception, the idea came up in my mind : if it can fit Notepad++, it can fit for any Windows program.
So here it is, with LGPL license to have no (almost not) restriction for integration in any project.
